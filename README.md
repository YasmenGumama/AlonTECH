FloodSense is an advanced real-time flood monitoring system that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology to mitigate flood risks in vulnerable communities. The system collects, processes, and analyzes environmental data through strategically placed sensors that measure water levels, rainfall intensity, and other critical parameters. Designed for local government units, disaster management agencies, and community leaders, FloodSense provides timely alerts and actionable intelligence through an intuitive dashboard interface. Users receive automated early warnings via SMS, mobile app notifications, and web portals, enabling proactive evacuation plans and resource allocation before flooding occurs. By bridging the gap between environmental data collection and practical disaster response, FloodSense represents a significant advancement in community resilience against increasingly frequent and severe flood events.
