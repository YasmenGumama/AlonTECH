    <h1>How Our System Works</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
      Our IoT-based flood monitoring system uses smart sensors deployed in key flood-prone areas to gather real-time data on water levels and rainfall intensity.

       FloodSense is designed to detect and respond to potential flood events quickly and accurately.
    </ul>
      Here‚Äôs how it works:
    <ul>

      <li> Sensor Monitoring
           - IoT sensors are installed in key locations to monitor water levels, rainfall, and other environmental factors 24/7.

      <li> Real-Time Data Transmission
           - The sensors automatically send real-time data to the FloodSense system through wireless networks.

      <li> Data Analysis
           - FloodSense analyzes the incoming data continuously. When abnormal patterns or critical levels are detected, the system triggers an alert.

      <li> Early Warning Notifications
           - Alerts are sent instantly via SMS, email, or app notifications to community members, local officials, and emergency responders.

      <li> Dashboard Monitoring
           - Users can view live updates, sensor status, and risk assessments directly from the FloodSense Dashboard, helping them make quick and informed decisions.
        </ul>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>üì° Sensors collect water level and rainfall data continuously.</li>
      <li>üåê Data is sent to the cloud and analyzed in real-time.</li>
      <li>üìä The system predicts flood risk based on intelligent algorithms.</li>
      <li>üö® Alerts are sent through SMS, email, and sirens to notify the public.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <ul>This proactive approach helps communities prepare and respond before a flood becomes dangerous. Our goal is to protect lives and property by enabling fast, data-driven decisions.
